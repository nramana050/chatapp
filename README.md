Steps to Deploy the Application

Install AWS CLI and Terraform:

Configure AWS CLI with aws credentials

Initialize and Apply:

Run terraform init to initialize Terraform.
Run terraform apply -auto-approve to deploy the infrastructure


Steps for Domain Registrar

Login to Domain Registrar:

Access your domain registrar's control panel.
Manage DNS Settings:

Navigate to the DNS settings for your domain.
Add A Records:

Create an A record for frontend.yourdomain.com pointing to the IP of the frontend server.
Create an A record for backend.yourdomain.com pointing to the IP of the backend server.
Save Changes:

Ensure the TTL is set appropriately, then save changes.

 Scalability Plan
For 25,000 Users
Horizontal Scaling:

Add more EC2 instances for frontend and backend.
Use Auto Scaling groups to automatically scale the number of instances based on load.
Database Scaling:

Use a larger instance for MongoDB or switch to Amazon DocumentDB for managed service with scalability.
Caching:

Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache frequent queries and reduce load on the database.
Load Balancing:

Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
Static Content Delivery:

Use Amazon S3 and CloudFront for delivering static content.

For 225,000 Users
Further Horizontal Scaling:

Increase the Auto Scaling group limits to handle more instances.
Consider multi-AZ deployments for higher availability.
Database Sharding:

Implement sharding in MongoDB to distribute database load across multiple servers.
Microservices Architecture:

Break the application into smaller microservices to handle specific functionalities independently.
Advanced Caching:

Use advanced caching strategies with ElastiCache for both Redis and Memcached.
Content Delivery Network (CDN):

Use CloudFront for global content distribution to reduce latency.
Queue Management:

Use Amazon SQS for managing background tasks and reducing load on the backend servers.
